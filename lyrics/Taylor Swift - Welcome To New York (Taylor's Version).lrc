[00:28.04]Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
[00:31.96]Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
[00:36.33]Everybody here wanted something more
[00:40.34]Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
[00:43.76]And it said
[00:44.49]Welcome to New York
[00:47.00]It's been waiting for you
[00:48.58]Welcome to New York
[00:50.14]Welcome to New York
[00:52.64]Welcome to New York
[00:55.26]It's been waiting for you
[00:56.78]Welcome to New York
[00:58.34]Welcome to New York
[01:00.04]
[01:01.39]It's a new soundtrack
[01:03.46]I could dance to this beat, beat forever more
[01:09.89]The lights are so bright
[01:11.70]But they never blind me, me
[01:17.29]Welcome to New York
[01:19.89]It's been waiting for you
[01:21.43]Welcome to New York
[01:22.96]Welcome to New York
[01:24.59]
[01:27.30]When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
[01:31.62]Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
[01:35.76]Everybody here was someone else before
[01:39.06]And you can want who you want
[01:41.98]Boys and boys and girls and girls
[01:44.03]Welcome to New York
[01:46.54]It's been waiting for you
[01:48.10]Welcome to New York
[01:49.58]Welcome to New York

[01:59.66]
[02:00.90]It's a new soundtrack
[02:02.97]I could dance to this beat, beat forever more
[02:09.40]The lights are so bright
[02:11.22]But they never blind me, me
[02:16.80]Welcome to New York
[02:19.41]It's been waiting for you
[02:20.92]Welcome to New York
[02:22.47]Welcome to New York
[02:23.85]
[02:25.21]Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
[02:29.44]Like any real love, it's ever changing
[02:33.46]Like any true love, it drives you crazy
[02:37.35]But you know you wouldn't change
[02:39.33]Anything, anything, anything
[02:45.54]Welcome to New York
[02:48.09]It's been waiting for you
[02:49.61]Welcome to New York
[02:51.17]Welcome to New York
[02:53.68]Welcome to New York
[02:56.26]It's been waiting for you
[02:57.82]Welcome to New York
[02:59.40]Welcome to New York
[03:01.11]
[03:02.44]It's a new soundtrack
[03:04.50]I could dance to this beat
[03:06.77]The lights are so bright
[03:08.64]But they never blind me
[03:11.21]New soundtrack
[03:12.73]It's been waiting for you
[03:15.03]The lights are so bright
[03:16.82]But they never blind me
[03:19.83]So bright, they never blind me
[03:25.50]Welcome to New York
